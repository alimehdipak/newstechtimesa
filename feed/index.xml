Anne was told to shave her head and lose just over a stone as part of her role on new movie Les Miserables.Anne Hathaway in Miami ( Image: SplashNews)Anne Hathaway in Miami ( Image: SplashNews)<br />

Rather than eating the recommended dietary allowance of around 2,000 calories a day, Anne is consuming fewer than 500, so that by the end of filming, she will be an emaciated size six.Anne Hathaway in a black ʙικιɴι at the beach in Miami ( Image: SplashNews)Anne Hathaway in Miami ( Image: SplashNews)<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-60 size-full" src="https://newstechtimesa.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Anne-Hathaway-in-Miami-2.jpg" alt="" width="615" height="410" srcset="https://newstechtimesa.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Anne-Hathaway-in-Miami-2.jpg 615w, https://newstechtimesa.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Anne-Hathaway-in-Miami-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /><br />
Having been given a break from filming in the UK, the actress decided to head home to the States and enjoyed a nice afternoon with her mum at the seaside.<br />

<p>She looked super toned as she strolled into the sea (while pretending to ignore the dozens of people staring at her, open mouthed) in simple a drawstring ʙικιɴι and oversized aviator shades.</p>

<p>The 29 year old plays a dying prosтιтute called Fantine in the iconic musical and was given less than a month to drop two dress sizes by the director.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harry Potter star Tom Felton has spoken of his “shame” over the way he and his castmates treated Emma Watson on the set of the first film.</p>
<p>Tom played Draco Malfoy in all eight instalments of the Harry Potter franchise, and admitted that in the early years of the series, the Gyryffindor/Slytherin divide spilled over into the real world.</p>
<p>“I suppose we thought we were a bit cooler,” the actor wrote in his new memoir Beyond The Wand: The Magic And Mayhem Of Growing Up A Wizard.</p>
<p>“We’d spend our free time together listening to rap music – Wu-Tang, Biggie, 2Pac.”</p>
<p>Tom went on to recall an incident in which a nine-year-old Emma – the only girl in the film’s main principal cast, who is three years his junior – had invited her co-stars to watch her perform a dance routine in her dressing room.<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-49 size-full" src="https://newstechtimesa.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/634fc392230000330084e4a8.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://newstechtimesa.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/634fc392230000330084e4a8.jpg 720w, https://newstechtimesa.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/634fc392230000330084e4a8-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>

<p>“We were predictably dismissive,” he wrote. “We sniggered our way down to Emma’s show, and the sniggers grew louder as she danced.</p>
<p>“We were just being sнιтty boys, largely out of awkwardness and because we thought taking the piss was cool, but Emma was visibly upset by our thoughtless reaction. I did feel like a bit of a dick, and rightly so.”<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-51 size-full" src="https://newstechtimesa.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/634fc3e022000062006e93b7.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="1105" srcset="https://newstechtimesa.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/634fc3e022000062006e93b7.jpg 720w, https://newstechtimesa.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/634fc3e022000062006e93b7-195x300.jpg 195w, https://newstechtimesa.vercel.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/634fc3e022000062006e93b7-667x1024.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><br />
Eventually, Tom apologised to Emma for his behaviour, and they “moved on”, although he says he still feels pangs of shame when he thinks of the incident.</p>
<p>He said: “It was just a stupid, teenage act of thoughtlessness, the sort of thing that happens every day. So why does that moment stick in my memory? Why is it so painful for me to recall?</p>
<p>“The answer, I think, is that I’ve grown to understand with the pᴀssing of the years that of all of us, Emma had the most to deal with, the most difficult situation to negotiate, and from the earliest age.”</p>
<p>“The last thing she needed,” he added. “In an environment that should have been – and normally was – safe and friendly and familial, was Josh [Gerdman, who played Goyle] and me laughing at her dance.<br />

“That’s why I feel ashamed by the memory of our behaviour. And that’s why I’m glad that our friendship did not founder on the rocks of my insensitivity, but became something deeper. A touchstone for both of our lives.”</p>
<p>During the recent Harry Potter reunion, Emma disclosed that she used to have a crush on Tom, which he has since confirmed was a mutual feeling, although they were never more than friends.</p>
